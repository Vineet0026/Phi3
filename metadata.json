[{"title": "The Worm-Like Chain Theory And Bending Of Short DNA", "author": "Alexey K. Mazur", "abstract": "The probability distributions for bending angles in double helical DNA obtained in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are compared with theoretical predictions. For double helices of one helical turn and longer, the computed distributions remarkably agree with the worm-like chain theory and qualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model. The computed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short DNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data. It is possible that current atomistic DNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length scales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals that the bending motion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the intermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected. These effects are essential for the interpretation of the experimental data and they also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.", "keywords": ["Worm-Like Chain Theory", "DNA Bending", "Molecular Dynamics", "Double Helical DNA", "Semi-Elastic Chain Model", "Atomic Force Microscopy"], "publication_date": "2007-04-30", "arxiv_id": "arXiv:0704.3948v1 [q-bio.BM]", "results": "The probability distributions of bend angles in DNA fragments obtained from the MD simulations show a remarkable agreement with the WLC theory, particularly for DNA segments of 1-2 helical turns.

This phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium-enhanced second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass. The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity. Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.", "keywords": ["Galaxy: formation", "globular clusters: general", "stars: horizontal-branch"], "publication_date": "2007-04-01", "arxiv_id": "arXiv:0704.0486v1", "results": ["These GCs are dominated by random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.", "Normal GCs in the outer halo share kinematic properties with extended HB GCs, suggesting an accretion origin.", "GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs.", "Normal GCs in the inner halo show signs of dissipational collapse when extended HB GCs are excluded."]}, {"title": "Compatibility of Exotic States with Neutron Star Observation", "author": "Chang Ho Hyun", "abstract": "We consider the effect of hard core repulsion in the baryon-baryon interaction at short distance to the properties of a neutron star.
